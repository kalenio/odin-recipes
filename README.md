# Summary

This is a simple recipe website built as a project for The Odin Project curriculum. It's not going to win any awards (yet...), but it gets the job done.

The recipes are real; I eat both on a regular basis, so check them out!

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to showcase and reinforce a variety of foundational programming and HTML skills including:

- Working with git and GitHub

  - The git work flow
  - Managing a git project through the command line and an IDE
  - Commit best practices
