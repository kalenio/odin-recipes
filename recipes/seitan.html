        Seitan is a healthy and tasty meat substitute. Its neutral flavor works well in a variety of dishes when paired with a sauce or glaze, and it has nearly as much protein per gram as chicken! It's the perfect dish for anyone mindful of their protein intake or while adhering to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Plus, it's cheap!

    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans chickpeas</li>
        <li>3.5 cups wheat gluten</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic Better Than Bouillon (chicken or beef is also tasty but not vegetarian)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon MSG (no, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-the-truth-about-msg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's not bad for you</a>)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil (vegetable oil works, too)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a blender, blend all the ingredients together, <strong>minus the wheat gluten</strong>.</li>
        <li>Add the blended ingredients into a large bowl with the wheat gluten.</li>
        <li>Knead the mix together gently for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Separate the dough into two pieces and place each half on a segment of heavy duty aluminum foil ~18" long.</li>
        <li>Shape each piece until it's... loaf-ish, then wrap in each side of the tinfoil.</li>
        <li>Bake in oven for 90 minutes @ 325&deg;, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>You're done! Slice each loaf into whatever size you like. I like to leave one loaf wrapped, place it in a gallon freezer bag, and place it in the freezer. It will easily keep for 3-4 weeks or longer once frozen.
        <p>
            Also try experimenting with browning the slices in a skillet after cooking. That's also a great time to include a tasty sauce/glaze like teriyaki!
